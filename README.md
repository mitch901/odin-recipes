# odin-recipes

My first project is to build a 3 page basic recipe website with skills I have picked up over the past 2 weeks such as importing images via absolute and relative paths, using anchor elements, paragraphs, heading sizes, unorginized lists and organized lists and commiting my project to GitHuB As well as adding new files and directories within directories.
